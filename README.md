# Bootstrap Portfolio

Welcome to my Bootstrap-powered portfolio website!

This project is a part of my web development journey, where I have recreated my portfolio site using Bootstrap. The portfolio showcases my work, skills, and provides information about me. I have followed the guidelines of the instructions given in the module challenge to construct a website with the help of Bootstrap templates. Creating this portfolio was an enriching experience that pushed me to learn and grow. Throughout the process, I encountered various challenges and spent countless hours refining and perfecting the design and functionality.

## Tools and Resources Used

• Bootstrap: Offered a collection of pre-designed components, responsive cards, and CSS styles that helped streamline the development process. By utilising Bootstrap, I was able to create a visually appealing and responsive portfolio that works seamlessly across different devices.

• Google Fonts: Custom fonts from Google Fonts have been integrated into the project to enhance typography and visual appeal.

• Unsplash: High-quality stock images from Unsplash have been used to create visually engaging content on the portfolio page.

• Coolors.co: The color palette for this project was selected using Coolors.co, ensuring a harmonious and cohesive visual experience.

• Streamline Icons: Icons for the navigation bar and Let's Get in Touch sections has been sourced from Streamline Icons, providing a professional touch to the design.

• Mentor Support: Drew and classmates have provided invaluable assistance throughout the project, offering guidance and clearing doubts whenever needed.

• GitHub Repository: This project's source code and related files are hosted on GitHub in a public repository. GitHub serves me as a version control system, allowing me to track changes made to the codebase, collaborate with others, and manage the development of the project.

• VS Code: Throughout the development process, VS Code proved to be an invaluable code editor.

## Struggles Overcome

I estimate that I spent around 15 hours working on this project, from planning and structuring the layout to refining the styling and ensuring a smooth deployment. These hours were filled with learning, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of seeing my portfolio come to life.

While the journey was challenging at times, the sense of accomplishment I feel now is incredibly rewarding. This portfolio is a testament to my dedication and commitment to honing my skills as a web developer.

- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the portfolio looks great on all screen sizes and devices was a challenge. I spent considerable time fine-tuning the responsive aspects to ensure a seamless user experience.

- Navigation Bar Customization: Customizing the navigation bar to match my vision took some trial and error. I explored Bootstrap documentation and experimented with different styles before achieving the desired look.

- Card Layout: Designing and implementing the card layout for the work section required careful consideration of the content and visual appeal. Balancing aesthetics and information was a creative challenge.
